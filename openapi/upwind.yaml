    ## Overview

    The Management REST API v1 represents a collection of endpoints designed for the execution of administrative tasks programmatically. Tailored for utilization by back-end servers or trusted entities, the API facilitates integration, data retrieval, and workflow automation.

    The API provides a powerful set of tools to interact with your organization's resources, including [Threats](/restapi/v1/threats), [Vulnerabilities](/restapi/v1/vulnerabilities), [Configurations](/restapi/v1/configurations), and [Workflows](/restapi/v1/workflows). Whether you are building applications, integrating services, or exploring data, this documentation serves as your guide through the various endpoints and functionalities offered by our API.

    When you make a request to the API, you will specify an HTTP method and a path. Additionally, you might also specify request headers and path, query, or body parameters. The API will return the response status code, response headers, and potentially a response body.

    The API reference documentation describes the HTTP method, path, and parameters for every operation. It also displays example requests and responses for each operation.

    ## Authentication

    To access the endpoints of the API, you need to authenticate your requests. We use OAuth 2.0, a widely adopted industry standard for authorization, to secure and control access to the API.

    The API uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) access tokens to authenticate requests. The API access token's scopes claim indicates which request methods can be performed when calling the API. Trying to perform any request method not permitted within the set scopes will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

    You can authenticate your request by adding an access token in the [Authorization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-20#section-2.1) HTTP header using the [Bearer authentication scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-20). To obtain an access token, you must first obtain client credentials.

    ### Obtaining client credentials

    Before you can make requests to the API, you will need to obtain client credentials. Follow the steps in the [Generate New Credentials](/settings/credentials#generate-new-credentials) section of the [Credentials](/settings/credentials) page to generate a client ID and client secret unique to your application.

    ### Obtaining access token

    Now that you have your client credentials, proceed with obtaining an access token. To get a token by using the client credentials grant, send a POST request to the OAuth 2.0 token endpoint URL (`/oauth/token`). All requests to the token endpoint should be an HTTP POST.

    :::important
    The `audience` parameter in your token request must match the regional API endpoint you plan to use. This ensures your access token is valid for the correct region. An access token obtained with `audience=https://api.upwind.io` will only work with the US API endpoint and cannot be used with EU or ME endpoints.
    :::

    #### For US region
    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url "https://auth.upwind.io/oauth/token" \
      --data-urlencode 'client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
      --data-urlencode 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
      --data-urlencode 'audience=https://api.upwind.io' \
      --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
    ```

    #### For EU region
    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url "https://auth.upwind.io/oauth/token" \
      --data-urlencode 'client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
      --data-urlencode 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
      --data-urlencode 'audience=https://api.eu.upwind.io' \
      --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
    ```

    #### For ME region
    ```bash
    curl --request POST \
      --url "https://auth.upwind.io/oauth/token" \
      --data-urlencode 'client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID' \
      --data-urlencode 'client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' \
      --data-urlencode 'audience=https://api.me.upwind.io' \
      --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials'
    ```

    :::warning
    Treat your access token like a password and consider using another service to store your token securely.
    :::

    ### Authenticating

    Once you have obtained an access token, you can authenticate your API requests by including it in the [Authorization](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-20#section-2.1) HTTP header using the [Bearer authentication scheme](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-20).

    For example, to authenticate a request to list threat detections, include your access token in the `Authorization` header:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ## Requests

    To make a request, first find the HTTP method and the path for the operation that you want to use. For example, the "List Threat Detections" operation uses the `GET` method and the `/threat-detections` path. For the full reference documentation for this operation, see [List Threat Detections](/restapi/v1/list-threat-detections).

    Prepend the base URL for the API to the path to get the full URL. Choose the appropriate regional endpoint:
    - **US**: `https://api.upwind.io`
    - **EU**: `https://api.eu.upwind.io`
    - **ME**: `https://api.me.upwind.io`

    For instance, on the command line, use the `curl` command. Specify the HTTP method using the `--request` or `-X` flag, and provide the full URL using the `--url` flag.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    :::note
    If you get a message similar to "command not found: curl", you may need to download and install `curl`. For more information, see [the curl project download page](https://curl.se/download.html).
    :::

    ### Using headers

    Most operations do not require specifying headers other than the `Authorization` header. Other operations may specify that you should pass an `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json` or additional headers.

    To send a header in a `curl` command, use the `--header` or `-H` flag followed by the header in `key: value` format.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ### Using path parameters

    Path parameters modify the operation path. For example, the "List threat detections" path is `/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections`. The curly brackets `{}` denote path parameters that you need to specify. In this case, you must specify your organization identifier. For the full reference documentation for this operation, see [List Threat Detections](/restapi/v1/list-threat-detections).

    For example, to get a list of Threat Detection objects from the `org_123456789` organization, replace `{organization-id}` with `org_123456789` and prepend the base URL for the API. The full path is `https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/org_123456789/threat-detections`.

    ### Using query parameters

    Query parameters allow you to control what data is returned for a request. For example, a query parameter may let you specify how many items are returned when the response is paginated.

    For `curl` commands, add a `?` to the end of the path, then append your query parameter name and value in the form `name=value`. Separate multiple query parameters with `&`.

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections?severity=CRITICAL" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ### Using body parameters

    Body parameters allow you to pass additional data to the API. For example, the "Update a threat detection" operation allows you to change the status of a detection. For the full reference documentation for this operation, see [Update a threat detection](/restapi/v1/update-threat-detection).

    For `curl` commands, use the `--data` flag to pass the body parameters in a JSON object.

    ```bash
    curl --request PATCH \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections/{detection-id}" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{
        "status": "ARCHIVED"
      }'
    ```

    The operation updates the threat detection and returns data about the modified detection. For more information about using the response, see the [Using the response](#using-the-response) section.

    ### Using the response

    Every request will return an HTTP status code that indicates the success of the response. For more information about response codes, see [the MDN HTTP response status code documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

    ### About the response code and headers

    To view the status code and headers, use the `--include` or `--i` flag when you send your request.

    For example, this request:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
      --include
    ```

    Returns the response code and headers like:

    ```bash
    HTTP/2 200
    ```

    In this example, the response code is `200`, which indicates a successful request.

    ### About the response body

    Most operations will return a response body. Unless otherwise specified, the response body is in JSON format.

    For example, this request returns a list of Threat Detection objects with data about each detection:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    You can also filter threat detections using query parameters. For example, to get all HIGH severity threat detections:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections?severity=HIGH" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ## Pagination

    Many list endpoints return large datasets that are divided into smaller, manageable chunks called pages. The API supports two types of pagination to help you navigate through these results efficiently.

    Each list endpoint supports one of the two pagination methods based on the potential amount of data that the endpoint can return. Information about which pagination method is used can be found on the specific endpoint's reference page.

    ### Page-based Pagination

    Page-based pagination uses traditional page numbers to navigate through results. This method is useful when you need to jump to specific pages or when the total number of pages is known.

    #### Parameters
    - `page`: Specifies the page number for pagination (default: 1)
    - `per-page`: Specifies how many results are returned on a page (default: 100)

    For example, to get the first page with 50 results per page:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections?page=1&per-page=50" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    To get the second page:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/threat-detections?page=2&per-page=50" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    ### Token-based Pagination

    Token-based pagination uses opaque tokens to navigate through results. This method is more efficient for large datasets and ensures consistent results even when data is being modified during pagination.

    #### Parameters
    - `page-token`: Specifies the token for fetching subsequent pages in a paginated result set
    - `per-page`: Specifies how many results are returned on a page (default: 100)

    #### Response Headers
    - `Link`: Provides pagination links for navigating through the result set, formatted as HTTP link headers

    For example, to get the first page:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/coniguration-findings?per-page=50" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    To get the next page, use the page-token from the previous response:

    ```bash
    curl --request GET \
      --url "https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/{organization-id}/coniguration-findings?page-token=eyJjdXJzb3IiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0&per-page=50" \
      --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    ```

    #### Working with Link Headers

    When using token-based pagination, the response includes a `Link` header with navigation URLs. This header follows the [RFC 5988](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5988) standard for web linking and provides ready-to-use URLs for pagination navigation.

    ```bash
    Link: <https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/org_123456789/configuration-findings?page-token=eyJjdXJzb3IiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIn0&per-page=50>; rel="next"
    ```

    The Link header may contain multiple relationships:
    - `rel="first"`: URL for the first page of results
    - `rel="next"`: URL for the next page of results (if available)
    - `rel="prev"`: URL for the previous page of results (if available)
    - `rel="last"`: URL for the last page of results (when determinable)

    Multiple links are comma-separated. For example:

    ```bash
    Link: <https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/org_123456789/configuration-findings?page-token=abc123>; rel="first", <https://api.upwind.io/v1/organizations/org_123456789/configuration-findings?page-token=xyz789>; rel="next"
    ```

    You can parse this header to automatically navigate through pages without manually constructing URLs or managing page tokens. This approach is particularly useful for automated data processing workflows where you need to iterate through all available data.

    ## Next steps
